# TODO

- aggregation of other leading static reports to then ingress into the security-scan. After all phases complete would echo out a 'master' report with multiple perspectives of security vulnerabilities
- Split steps into config and utils so the main workflow yml is cleaner
- each issue opened should be per repo
- clean up print out for each security scan type (maybe use a .template file to keep it clean and easy to edit)
- remove codeql for now
